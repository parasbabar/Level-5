## ✨ What is PrivEstate?

**PrivEstate** is a privacy-preserving fractional real estate investment MVP built on the **Midnight Network**.

Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization allows multi-million dollar properties to be divided into liquid, accessible fractional shares. However, traditional public blockchains force all wallet balances, cap tables, investment figures, and rental payouts into the clear for any observer to inspect.

PrivEstate resolves this dilemma using Midnight's **Compact** smart contract language and **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs**:

* **Fractional Property Ownership**: High-value properties are divided into tokenized fractional shares (e.g., 100,000 shares).
* **Private Investor Holdings**: Share allocations and capital balances are stored off-chain in client-shielded witness state.
* **Confidential Investment Amounts**: The exact dollar amount deployed by an investor is never recorded on the public ledger.
* **Zero-Knowledge Ownership Threshold Proofs**: Investors mathematically prove they satisfy an ownership requirement without disclosing their exact holdings.
* **Compliance & Accreditation Verification**: Investors prove their capital meets statutory accreditation standards (e.g., $\ge \$250,000$) without disclosing total net worth or bank statements.
* **Confidential Rental-Yield Verification**: Investors verify rental distributions meet target benchmarks without revealing private payout figures.
* **Auditor & Regulator Verification**: Third parties verify mathematical validity on-chain through public verification audit counters without exposing confidential investor data.

> **Example**: An investor privately holds **17.43%** (17,430 shares) of a property. When joining a syndicate requiring a 10% minimum, the investor generates a ZK proof asserting:  
> **"I own at least 10% of this property."**  
> The verifier confirms the threshold claim with mathematical certainty, while the investor's exact 17.43% holding remains completely secret.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Public blockchains introduce a fundamental **transparency-vs-privacy conflict** for financial and real estate applications:

1. **Exposure of Sensitive Ownership**: On public ledgers, every token balance is visible. Competitors, tenants, and adversaries can inspect an investor's exact holdings, asset accumulation strategy, and property stake.
2. **Confidential Capital at Risk**: High-net-worth individuals and corporate syndicates cannot accept having total deployed capital and liquidity publicly searchable.
3. **Rental Income & Distribution Privacy**: Exposing ongoing rental income payouts leaks personal cash flow and financial profiles.
4. **Intrusive All-or-Nothing Compliance**: Traditional off-chain syndicates force investors to hand over full tax filings, bank statements, and identification to prove eligibility, creating centralized data honeypots prone to breaches.

---

## 💡 Solution

PrivEstate applies Midnight's **selective-disclosure model** to real-world asset investing:

> *"Reveal the result that needs to be verified, not the private data used to produce it."*

* **Decoupled Verification**: The application verifies predicates over private data inside local zero-knowledge circuits.
* **Succinct Ledger State**: The public ledger records property parameters and increments public verification counters (`verifiedOwnershipCount`, `verifiedComplianceCount`, `verifiedRentalYieldCount`).
* **Zero Data Honeypots**: Auditors, syndicate managers, and regulators receive cryptographic guarantees without storing or inspecting raw investor financial records.

## 🔐 Privacy Model

PrivEstate strictly partitions application state between private witness data and public verifiable ledger state:

### 🔒 Strictly Private (Shielded Client-Side)
* **Investor Ownership Shares**: Exact share count (e.g., 17,430 shares) resides strictly in client-shielded witness storage.
* **Capital Invested**: Exact dollar amount deployed (e.g., $500,000) is shielded from external inspection.
* **Confidential Rental Income**: Annual rental payouts, yield distributions, and bank routing details remain private.
* **Private Identity & Secret Keys**: Cryptographic salt and private keys used to derive Zero-Knowledge commitments.
* **Private Verification Inputs**: Raw numbers used during witness execution are never transmitted across the network.

### 🌐 Public & Verifiable (On-Chain Midnight Ledger)
* **Contract Address**: Deployed contract identity on Midnight Preprod.
* **Network Identifier**: Target environment (`preprod`).
* **Property Metadata**: Public asset identifiers (`propertyId`), total authorized shares (`totalShares`), and compliance minimums (`complianceMinimum`).
* **Verification Audit Counters**: Incremented on-chain counters recording valid proofs (`verifiedOwnershipCount`, `verifiedComplianceCount`, `verifiedRentalYieldCount`).
* **Last Verified Threshold**: Publicly disclosed threshold benchmark from the latest successful verification.
* **Transaction Identifiers**: Real Midnight Preprod transaction IDs confirming state changes.

*PrivEstate does not claim that every transaction detail is publicly visible; privacy is preserved by disclosing only the verified boolean outcome to the ledger.*

---

## 🧠 Smart Contract

The core contract is implemented in Midnight's **Compact** language:
📄 [contracts/privestate.compact](contracts/privestate.compact)

### Implemented Circuits

1. **`proveOwnershipThreshold(requiredShares: Uint<64>): []`**
   - **Private Witness**: `getInvestorOwnership()`
   - **Public Input**: `requiredShares`
   - **ZK Constraint**: `actualOwnership >= requiredShares && actualOwnership <= totalShares`
   - **Ledger Effect**: Increments `verifiedOwnershipCount` and records `lastVerifiedThreshold = disclose(requiredShares)`.

2. **`proveCompliance(minimumRequired: Uint<64>): []`**
   - **Private Witness**: `getInvestmentAmount()`
   - **Public Input**: `minimumRequired`
   - **ZK Constraint**: `actualInvestment >= minimumRequired`
   - **Ledger Effect**: Increments `verifiedComplianceCount`.

3. **`proveRentalClaim(minimumYield: Uint<64>): []`**
   - **Private Witness**: `getRentalIncome()`
   - **Public Input**: `minimumYield`
   - **ZK Constraint**: `actualRental >= minimumYield`
   - **Ledger Effect**: Increments `verifiedRentalYieldCount`.

4. **`computeInvestorCommitment(sk: Bytes<32>, propId: Bytes<32>): Bytes<32>`**
   - **Pure Circuit**: Computes a deterministic identity hash:
     `persistentHash([pad(32, "privestate:inv:"), propId, sk])`
   - Allows investors to prove identity binding across transactions without disclosing their secret key.

---

## 🏘️ Property Marketplace

The marketplace presents tokenized Real-World Assets configured for demonstration on Midnight Preprod:

* **Featured Property**: *Sunrise Luxury Residences*
* **Property ID**: `PROP-001`
* **Total Asset Valuation**: $5,000,000 USD
* **Fractional Share Supply**: 100,000 fractional shares ($50 / share)
* **Projected Rental Yield**: 8.4% APY
* **Statutory Compliance Minimum**: $250,000 USD (Accredited Tier)

Users can connect a Midnight wallet, select an allocation, and acquire fractional shares via real Midnight Preprod transactions. The marketplace includes per-property state isolation and persistent holding badges to support multi-property workflows.

---

## 👛 Wallet Integration

PrivEstate natively integrates with the **Midnight DApp Connector Standard** (`@midnight-ntwrk/dapp-connector-api`) for the **Midnight Lace Wallet**:

* **Connector Detection**: Automatically detects `window.midnight.mnLace` on page load.
* **Network Validation**: Verifies the wallet is connected to the **Midnight Preprod** network.
* **Shielded Identity**: Safely accesses shielded addresses and coin public keys to derive deterministic, wallet-scoped client storage.
* **Contract Interaction**: Executes contract calls with automatic proof generation.
* **Real Preprod Transactions**: Submits scoped transactions signed by the user's wallet with confirmation tracking.
* **Stale Lock Resilience**: Includes automatic retry handling with exponential backoff for wallet extension internal queue locks.

> ⚠️ **Security Notice**: PrivEstate never requests, stores, or handles wallet seed phrases or private signing keys. All authorization occurs inside the user's Midnight Lace Wallet extension.

---

## 📊 Portfolio

The **Shielded Portfolio** view displays the investor's confidential position:

* **Private Fractional Shares**: Displayed as share quantity and calculated ownership percentage.
* **Shielded Capital Invested**: Total fiat-equivalent capital deployed into the asset.
* **Estimated Annual Rental Yield**: Expected annual rental disbursements based on ownership.
* **Visual Privacy Masking**: Toggleable masking button (`Mask Private Values / Reveal Shielded Values`) allowing investors to safely navigate the interface in public settings without exposing figures.
* **Scenario Adjustment**: Ability to adjust test holding amounts to test different verification threshold outcomes against the contract.

---

## 🛡️ Proof Verification

PrivEstate provides an intuitive interface for generating and inspecting Zero-Knowledge proofs:

1. **Ownership Threshold Verification**: Choose a property and threshold (e.g., 5%, 10%, 20%). The Compact circuit evaluates the witness locally and increments the on-chain audit counter.
2. **Accreditation & Compliance Verification**: Select standard accreditation tiers ($100k, $250k, $500k). The circuit verifies compliance without revealing deployed capital.
3. **Confidential Rental Yield Verification**: Prove annual earnings meet a benchmark yield without disclosing payout amounts.
4. **Auditor & Regulator Verification Portal**: A dedicated verifier view displaying the complete on-chain audit log. Auditors verify proof status (`VALID`), circuit identifier (`proveOwnershipThreshold.zkir`), and identity commitments while confirming that underlying values remain masked (`🔒 NOT DISCLOSED`).

---

## 🧪 Testing

PrivEstate includes an automated test suite verifying contract execution, private witness behavior, circuit constraints, and ledger assertions:
📄 [tests/privestate.test.ts](tests/privestate.test.ts)

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

### Verified Test Results: 8/8 Passing

1. **Contract Initialization**: Verifies initial ledger parameters (`propertyId`, `totalShares`, `complianceMinimum`, counters at 0) while confirming private state is shielded off-chain.
2. **Valid Ownership Threshold Proof (PASS)**: Confirms that an investor holding 17.43% satisfies a 10% threshold claim, incrementing the public counter without leaking the exact share count.
3. **Invalid Ownership Threshold Proof (FAIL)**: Confirms contract assertion rejects claims when holdings (7%) fall below the requested threshold (10%).
4. **Regulatory Accreditation Proof (PASS)**: Validates compliance proof when capital ($500,000) meets the statutory minimum ($250,000) without revealing the investment amount.
5. **Sub-Threshold Compliance Rejection (FAIL)**: Rejects accreditation proof when capital ($150,000) is below the required threshold ($250,000).
6. **Confidential Rental Yield Claim (PASS)**: Verifies rental yield claim ($\ge \$30,000$) against private income ($45,000$) without exposing actual earnings.
7. **Invalid Rental Yield Rejection (FAIL)**: Confirms rejection when claimed yield ($\ge \$60,000$) exceeds actual earnings ($45,000$).
8. **Cryptographic Identity Commitment**: Confirms deterministic investor commitment derivation over identity secret keys and property identifiers without exposing the secret.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Notes

* **Experimental Demonstration**: PrivEstate is a technical prototype developed for the Midnight Builder Challenge Level 4. It operates on the Midnight Preprod test network.
* **Testnet Assets**: Do not transfer real-world capital, production credentials, or real securities to testnet addresses.
* **Credential Safety**: Never commit `.env` files, wallet recovery phrases, or private keys to source control.
* **Witness Confidentiality**: Private witness data is processed locally within the client and is never transmitted in cleartext over the network.
